        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery) is an MRI sequence used to suppress the effects of fluid in the brain, particularly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This technique helps in visualizing lesions that are otherwise obscured by CSF in other imaging sequences.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Suppression of CSF:</strong> FLAIR sequences are particularly useful for identifying lesions in the brain by nullifying the signal from the CSF, which makes it easier to see abnormalities in the brain tissue.</li>
            <li><strong>Contrast with Other Sequences:</strong> Unlike T1 and T2-weighted images, FLAIR images highlight lesions and pathological changes in the white matter and subcortical regions, providing a clearer view of areas affected by diseases like multiple sclerosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Clinical Applications:</strong> FLAIR is commonly used in the assessment of various neurological conditions, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. It helps in differentiating between various types of lesions and assessing their extent.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The FLAIR sequence involves an inversion recovery pulse sequence that nullifies the signal from fluids, primarily CSF. This is achieved by applying an inversion pulse before the standard spin echo sequence, which causes the CSF to have a null signal at the time of image acquisition.</p>
        
        <h2>Image Example</h2>
        <p>The image below shows a typical FLAIR MRI scan. Note how the CSF appears dark while the lesions and abnormalities are highlighted.</p>
